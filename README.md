# 👋 Hey, I’m Frank  

**CTO | Product & Engineering Leader | Fintech Nerd | Web3 Enthusiast | AI Explorer**

I’ve spent years leading global engineering and product teams, scaling fintech, payments, and marketplace platforms. I specialize in modernizing legacy stacks and shipping big things without losing the startup spirit.  

These days, I’m rediscovering the fun of coding and chasing the blazingly fast-moving world of **AI**.
